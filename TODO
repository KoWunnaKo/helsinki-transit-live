Helsinki Transit Live 0.6
=========================

 [X] Use a persistent HTTP connection (this should make updating
     more regular and reliable)

Helsinki Transit Live 1.0
=========================

 * Port zoom level locking from Poor?
 * Allow landscape by Page.allowedOrientations
   - Need to figure out how to rotate gestures too
 * Bump PyOtherSide API version when available and replace all sync
   calls with async ones assuming they no longer crash
 * Check versions of Qt components (bump to 5.2?)
