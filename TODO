Helsinki Transit Live 0.3
=========================

 [X] Increase data download timeout to ten seconds
 [X] Set user agent for data downloading
 [X] Allow plus and minus keys to be used for zooming (this is to ease
     testing on the emulator and hopefully doesn't break anything in
     actual device use)
