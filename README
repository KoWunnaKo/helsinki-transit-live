Helsinki Transit Live
=====================

Helsinki Transit Live shows real-time locations of Helsinki Region
Transport (HSL) public transportation vehicles. It uses the HSL Live
API [1] and should display data matching the official web interface [2].

Helsinki Transit Live has been written for Sailfish OS, but should
probably work with minor modifications on other platforms where Python
and basic Qt and QML components are available.

Helsinki Transit Live is free software released under the GNU General
Public License (GPL), see the file 'COPYING' for details.

To run Helsinki Transit Live on a Sailfish system, you need

 * qt5-qtdeclarative-import-location
 * qt5-qtdeclarative-import-positioning
 * qt5-plugin-geoservices-nokia
 * pyotherside-qml-plugin-python3-qt5

For testing purposes you can just run
'/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmlscene qml/helsinki-transit-live.qml'.
For installation, see the file 'INSTALL'.
